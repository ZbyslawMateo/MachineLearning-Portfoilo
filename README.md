# Machine Learning projects

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks, which are the outcomes of university assignments from Machine Learning course. All were done in a group of three students.

Assignment 7 - final project was based on self-chosen problem and dataset and shows the whole ML pipeline for image classification.

Assignments and their purpose:

1. Getting started - Copenhagen Airbnb.ipynb

    The assignment focuses on analyzing Airbnb listings in Copenhagen. The primary tasks involve performing exploratory data analysis and creating visualizations to understand various aspects of the Airbnb market in Copenhagen.

2. Classification The Candidates Part 1.ipynb

    The primary goal of the second assignment was to analyze the responses of candidates who participated in political tests conducted by two television networks: DR and TV2. The analysis aimed to explore the ages of candidates, provide an overview of the most confident candidates, and examine differences in responses on both inter-party and intra-party levels. A key aspect of this assignment was to apply various machine learning models to predict party affiliations based on the candidates' responses.

3. Feature Engineering Waterworks.ipynb

    The objective was to explore the dataset to gain insights into the features and their distributions and to preprocess the data to address issues such as missing values, outliers, etc.

4. Long-Term Correction of Wind Data Using Regression Models.ipynb

    The assignment focuses on optimizing the long-term correction (LTC) of wind data using regression models. This problem is crucial for Vestas, a leading wind energy company, which relies on accurate long-term wind data to plan new wind farm locations. The objective is to determine if regression models can effectively replace neural networks for generating LTC wind data, potentially saving time and costs.

5. Candidate Test 2022 II - final.ipynb

    The primary focus of this assignment was to conduct a thorough analysis of candidate responses from two Danish television networks to understand the political landscape, evaluate the central questions, and apply clustering techniques to explore potential reconfigurations of political party groupings.

6. Neural networks I - Sentiment analysis_final.ipynb

    The assignment focuses on the sentiment analysis based on movie reviews created by the internet users using a neural network.

7. final_project_gemstones.ipynb

    The final project aimed to develop a tool for recognizing gemstone categories based on a dataset from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lsind18/gemstones-images] containing over 3200 images of different gemstones. The classification of the gemstones presents an interesting challenge due to the diversity in colours, shapes, and structures captured in the images.
